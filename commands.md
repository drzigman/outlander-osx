## Automapper

Outlander supports Genie map files.  View maps via the `âŒ˜M` shortcut.  Mouse over a map node to see its name and `roomid`.  Your `roomid` can be referenced as a global variable, `$roomid`, and the id of the current map can be referenced as `$zoneid`.

#### Automapper Usage

* `#goto <roomid>`, `#goto <named room>`
    ex: `#goto 123`  `#goto bank`

Sometimes the automapper can get confused and not know what room you're in.  Use these commands to help:

* `#goto <roomid> from <roomid>` - use when you know what room you're in and have the automapper find a path from there.
* `#mapper`
    * `#mapper reset` - will attempt to find what room/map your character is located in
    * `#mapper reload` - will reload map files from disk

#### Automapper Installation
* Use svn from terminal to download maps: `$ svn checkout http://svn.code.sf.net/p/geniemapsfordr/Genie3Maps/trunk Maps`
* Put the maps in the `/Documents/Outlander/Maps` folder
* You will also need the `automapper.cmd` script found listed under the [example scripts](#example-scripts)
    * Create a new script file named `automapper.cmd`, paste in the text from the gist, and save it to `/Documents/Outlander/Scripts`
* Use `svn update` from the folder created with the `svn checkout` command to fetch the latest maps

#### Automapper FAQ
> The automapper sometimes gets stuck, is this normal?

Yes - the Genie map files have several commands that are not yet fully supported.  As Outlander's script engine becomes more robust the `automapper.cmd` script will be updated to support those commands.

## Configuration Commands

* `#alias <name> <replacement>`
    * setup an alias
    * ex: `#alias l2 load arrows`
* `#bug` - opens the website to submit a bug
* `#class`
    * `#class (list|load|save|clear)`
    * `#class combat on` - this activates the `combat` class
    * `#class combat off` - this deactivates the `combat` class
    * `#class all on` - this activates all classes
    * `#class all off` - this deactivates all classes
    * `#class +combat -app` this activates the `combat` class and deactivates the `app` class
* `#var`
    * set global var
    * ex: `#var primary.container backpack`
* `#highlight`
    * add highlight
    * ex: `#highlight #AD0000 a silver clenched fist`
* `#mapper`
    * `#mapper reset` - will attempt to find what room/map your character is located in
    * `#mapper reload` - will reload map files from disk
* `#script (abort|pause|resume|vars) <script name>`
    * control running scripts
    * to control all scripts use `all` for the script name: `#script <action> all`
    * ex: #script pause all
    * ex: #script pause forage
    * ex: #script resume forage
    * ex: #script vars forage
        * vars will display the current list of local script variables.
* `#parse <text>`
	* sends the text to be parsed by the scripting engine, as if sent by the game
* `#play` - play a sound file
  * `#play stop` - stops all playing sounds
  * `#play <filename>` plays the given sound file
  * If the file exists in the Outlander `Sounds` folder, you can leave off the full path and just use the file name, such as `spooky.mp3`.  Otherwise you will need to provide the full path to the file, such as `/Users/joe/Documents/Sounds/spooky.wav`.
* `#window add/show/hide/clear <name>`
  * ex: `#window add log`
  * ex: `#window hide log`
  * `#window list all` will show all window ids and locations.
    * The output: (x,y), (height, width)
    * x,y being the point of the top-left corner.  Height going down and width across.
    * `->` represents what window messages are forwarded to if that window is hidden. Ex: `atmospherics->main` means messages send to the `atmospherics` window will be forwarded to the `main` window.  Set the `closedTarget` in `layout.cfg` for the given window to accomplish this.
  ```

## Scripting

#### Example Scripts
* Repository of several scripts: https://github.com/joemcbride/outlander-osx-scripts
* [hunt.cmd](https://github.com/joemcbride/outlander-osx-scripts/blob/master/hunt.cmd) - basic hunt script
```
supported options: throw, lob, hurl, offhand, ambush, poach, snipe, exp

.hunt offhand lob nightstick
.hunt poach shortbow
.hunt ambush "short sword"
```
* [disarm.cmd](https://github.com/joemcbride/outlander-osx-scripts/blob/master/disarm.cmd) - disarm and pick boxes (supports lockpick rings or loose lockpicks, removes and re-equips armor)
* [swim.cmd](https://github.com/joemcbride/outlander-osx-scripts/blob/master/swim.cmd) - swim between two rooms `.swim north south`
* [simpletravel.cmd](https://github.com/joemcbride/outlander-osx-scripts/blob/master/simpletravel.cmd) - travel to locations across maps  `.simpletravel "w gate" brook`
* [automapper.cmd](https://github.com/joemcbride/outlander-osx-scripts/blob/master/automapper.cmd) - required for `#goto` map commands to work.  Set `#var powerwalk 1` to enable powerwalking to the given destination.

#### Scripting Basics
```
.myscript one two "three four"
```

Script arguments become local variables:

    %scriptname = myscript
	%0 = one two "three four"
	%1 = one
	%2 = two
	%3 = three four
    %argcount = 3

Use `#` to add comments to your script.

```
# collect items
loop:
  put collect rock
  pause 2
  goto loop
```

* \#beep
    * performs a system beep
* `#echo [>targetWindow] [color[,backgroundcolor]] <text>`
    * echo a message to a window
    * text - The text you want to echo
    * window (optional) - The target window you want to echo to.  Defaults to main.
    * color (optional) - The foreground color.  Use hex color.
    * backgroundcolor (optional) - The background color.

}
```
* `matchre("<variable>", "<regex>")` function - can be used to evaluate to true/false within an `if` expression

```
* `replacere("<variable>", "<regex>", "<replacement>")` function - can be used to do a regex replace on a variable

* `countsplit` function - counts the number of occurances of the given character
```

```
* variable indexers - variables with `|` delimiters can be used as sudo arrays with indexers
```
var weapons sword|longbow|scimitar

echo %weapons(0) # prints sword
echo %weapons[1] # prints longbow
echo %weapons(2) # prints scimitar
```
